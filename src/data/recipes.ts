    ingredients: [
      "300 g all-purpose or plain flour",
      "60 g granulated sugar or sweetener",
      "18 g baking powder",
      "0.25 teaspoon baking soda*",
      "3 g salt",
      "440 ml milk",
      "60 g butter",
      "10 ml pure vanilla extract",
      "1 large egg",
      ],
    side_note: `
      *For fluffier pancakes, you can add baking soda, however, if you're
      sensitive to the taste, leave it out. Usually, for every cup of flour, add ⅛
      of a teaspoon of baking soda. This will turn your plain/all-purpose flour
      into self-raising flour.

    steps: [
      "Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.",
      "Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay). The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency.",
      "Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.",
      "Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.",
      "When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.",
      "Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!",
